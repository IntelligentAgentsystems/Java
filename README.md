Java / Akka based Agentsystems

The code of this project realizes a basic ping-pong actor system.

It ping-pongs 3 times before shutting down on its own.

### Specks
* ***Package Management:*** Maven
* ***Java Version:*** 11 (should run fine with 8 but bom.xml was set to 11)
* ***.gitignore:*** setup for IntelliJ, Maven and Java (generated by [gitignore.io](https://gitignore.io))

### Useful Akka Links

* [Akka Docu](https://doc.akka.io/docs/akka/2.6.0/index.html) *(make sure to select java :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:)*

### DISCLAIMER
~I do **NOT** take responsibility for the effectiveness or correctness of this code!
Use it on your own risk!~

The original code of this was based on a tutorial I found and updated to work with Akka 2.6 by me,
I then reworked the code to make better use of modern Akka.
Nevertheless, I take NO responsibility for the correct application of the actuator pattern
nor the efficiency of the code nor the correct use of the Akka framework.

Feel free to update, correct, improve or update this repo as you see fit!

Hope you found this repo useful or informative and good luck to us all for the project ahead! :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
